                Saket was a very skinny kid in high school. According to him,
                his small physical stature made him unconfident. Saket started
                his fitness journey in 2016 after getting inspired by his
                childhood friend Aryan Khanna (another popular fitness vlogger).
                Apparently, Aryan was also a skinny kid in high school, but he
                started gyming and gaining muscles. This motivated Saket to
                follow in his footsteps. For the next two years, Saket and Aryan
                worked diligently towards achieving their fitness goals.

                by calling him 'Suck It' instead of 'Saket' Saket was a

                He is a non-vegetarian and loves to eat grilled chicken. He
                makes sure that at least one of his everyday meals contains
                chicken, which provides him with his daily dose of protein,
                required for gaining muscle mass.
              </li>
              <li>

                In a YouTube video, Saket has mentioned that he did not borrow
                money from his parents to fund his YouTube videos. He shot the
                initial videos on his mobile phone, and later, he bought a
                camera, iPhone, and MacBook with the money he earned from
                YouTube AdSense.
